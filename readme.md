## Structure ##

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in my project.

    .
    ├── css
    ├── server
    ├── src
    ├── .babelrc
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── screenshot.png

1.  **`/public`**: Here you can find public files and favicon files.
 
2.  **`/server`**: Very simple express server.
  
3.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all the necessary files such as React components and styles.

4.  **`.babelrc`**: Configuration file for babel.
  
5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for project.

8.  **`screenshot.png`**: Screenshot of the final website.

9.  **`readme.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about project.
